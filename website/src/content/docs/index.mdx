:::caution[Beta Software]
SecBeat is pre-1.0 software under active development. Not recommended for production use without thorough testing.
:::

## Architecture

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="eBPF/XDP (Linux)" icon="shield">
    Kernel-level packet filtering using XDP. Implemented and functional on Linux 5.15+.

    - IP blocklist with O(1) lookup
    - SYN cookie generation
    - Per-CPU statistics
    - **Requires**: `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_BPF`
  </Card>

  <Card title="WASM Rules Engine" icon="rocket">
    Hot-reloadable WAF rules using Wasmtime 29. No restart required.

    - 3 example modules included
    - Fuel-limited execution (100K instructions)
    - JSON-based request context
    - Sandboxed execution
  </Card>

  <Card title="L7 WAF" icon="approve-check">
    Production-ready HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy with 100+ attack patterns.

    - SQL injection (~30 rules)
    - XSS detection (~35 rules)
    - Path traversal (~21 rules)
    - TLS 1.2/1.3 (Rustls 0.23)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Distributed (Beta)" icon="external">
    NATS-based messaging for multi-node deployments.

    - Real-time event sync
    - Fleet management
    - CRDT state sync (partial)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/secbeat.git
cd secbeat && cargo build --release --workspace

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Test the proxy
curl -k https://localhost:8443/
```

## Configuration Example

```toml
[platform]
mode = "l7"
environment = "development"

[network]
public_port = 8443
backend_port = 8080

[waf]
enabled = true
block_sql_injection = true
block_xss = true

[metrics]
enabled = true
bind_address = "0.0.0.0:9191"
```

## Current Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| L7 HTTP/HTTPS Proxy | ✅ Stable | Hyper 1.x, Rustls 0.23 |
| WAF Engine | ✅ Stable | 100+ patterns, latency histograms |
| eBPF/XDP | ✅ Implemented | Linux only, 232 lines |
| WASM Runtime | ✅ Implemented | Wasmtime 29, 3 modules |
| SYN Proxy | ⚠️ Prototype | 729 lines, functional |
| CRDT Sync | ⚠️ Partial | Basic implementation |
| Orchestrator | ⚠️ Beta | Hardcoded config |

Built with Rust for memory safety and performance.
