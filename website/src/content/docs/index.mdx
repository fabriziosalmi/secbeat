## Kernel-First Architecture

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="eBPF Kernel Mode" icon="shield">
    XDP programs running at the lowest level. Drop attacks before they touch the network stack.

    - **Sub-20µs** packet processing
    - **1%** CPU usage
    - **10M+ PPS** capacity
  </Card>

  <Card title="WASM Hot Reload" icon="rocket">
    Update detection rules without restarting. WASM modules loaded dynamically.

    - Dynamic rule updates
    - Zero downtime
    - Sandboxed execution
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rust Safety" icon="approve-check">
    Memory safe by design. Zero-cost abstractions with borrow checker guarantees.

    - No memory leaks
    - Thread safety
    - Zero-cost abstractions
  </Card>

  <Card title="Global Sync (CRDTs)" icon="external">
    Distributed mitigation decisions. Real-time sync via NATS.

    - Multi-region deployment
    - Eventually consistent
    - Conflict-free replication
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```toml
[mitigation]
interface = "eth0"
mode = "xdp"
threshold_pps = 1_000_000

[wasm]
rules_dir = "./rules"
hot_reload = true
```

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn check_packet() {
  if is_syn_flood() {
    emit_verdict(XDP_DROP);
  }
}
```

## Don't Trust Our Words

Trust the borrow checker. SecBeat is built in Rust, leveraging the language's memory safety guarantees and zero-cost abstractions to deliver maximum performance without sacrificing reliability.
