# 🛡️ SecBeat Mitigation Node - Phase 4 Complete: Orchestrator Integration

## 🚀 Phase 4 Achievement: Full Fleet Management & Orchestrator Integration

### **L7 TLS/HTTP Proxy with Orchestrator Integration**

The SecBeat mitigation node now includes complete orchestrator integration for fleet management:

1. **L7 TLS/HTTP Reverse Proxy** 
   - Full TLS termination with rustls and tokio-rustls
   - Self-signed certificate support for testing
   - HTTP request parsing and processing with hyper
   - Async multi-threaded architecture with tokio
   - Backend HTTP proxying with header forwarding
   - Structured logging with tracing

2. **Orchestrator Integration**
   - Automatic node registration with unique UUID assignment
   - Real-time heartbeat mechanism (30-second intervals)
   - Node status reporting (Starting → Active → Dead cycle)
   - System metrics collection and reporting
   - Fleet visibility and monitoring
   - Failed heartbeat detection and recovery

3. **Fleet Management Features**
   - Central orchestrator for multi-node coordination
   - Node discovery and registration
   - Health monitoring and status tracking
   - Metrics aggregation and fleet statistics
   - Auto-scaling readiness with node lifecycle management

4. **DDoS Protection (Layer 7)**
   - Connection-level rate limiting before TLS handshake
   - Token bucket rate limiting (100 req/sec per IP by default)
   - Per-IP connection limits (10 concurrent by default)
   - Global connection limits (1000 total by default)
   - IP whitelist/blacklist with CIDR support
   - Automatic blacklisting for repeated violations

5. **WAF Placeholder Implementation**
   - HTTP request inspection (URI, headers, user-agent)
   - Basic pattern matching for suspicious content
   - Script tag detection (`<script>` in URI)
   - Path traversal detection (`..` in URI)
   - Request blocking with HTTP 403 responses
   - Detailed request logging for analysis

6. **Enhanced Metrics Collection**
   - Prometheus metrics endpoint (HTTP on :9090)
   - HTTPS request tracking
   - TLS handshake metrics (completed, errors)
   - WAF blocking statistics
   - Request proxying success/failure rates
   - Real-time connection monitoring
   - Fleet-level metrics aggregation

## 📊 Orchestrator Integration Metrics

### Node Registration & Heartbeat
- Automatic node registration with orchestrator
- Real-time heartbeat every 30 seconds
- Node status: `Starting` → `Active` → `Dead`
- System metrics: CPU usage, memory usage, connections, requests

### Fleet Statistics API
```json
{
  "total_nodes": 1,
  "active_nodes": 1,
  "dead_nodes": 0,
  "avg_cpu_usage": 0.0,
  "avg_memory_usage": 0.0,
  "total_pps": 0,
  "total_connections": 0
}
```

## 🏗️ Complete Architecture

```
[Client] --TLS--> [127.0.0.1:8443 L7 Proxy] --HTTP--> [127.0.0.1:8080 Origin]
                            ↓                              ↓
                  [127.0.0.1:9090 Metrics]      [Test Origin Server]
                            ↓
              [127.0.0.1:3030 Orchestrator] ---> [Fleet Management]
```

### For Proxmox Deployment:
```
[Internet] --HTTPS--> [Node1:8443, Node2:8443] --HTTP--> [Backends]
                              ↓
                    [Orchestrator:3030] ---> [Fleet API, Auto-scaling]
```

## 🧪 Phase 4 Test Results

### **End-to-End Integration Test**

✅ **Node Registration**: Automatic registration with orchestrator successful  
✅ **Heartbeat Mechanism**: 30-second heartbeat cycle working perfectly  
✅ **Fleet Visibility**: Node appears in orchestrator fleet statistics  
✅ **HTTPS Connectivity**: TLS proxy handling requests correctly  
✅ **Metrics Integration**: Both node and fleet metrics available  
✅ **Status Management**: Node lifecycle (Starting → Active) working  
✅ **Error Recovery**: Node reconnection and status recovery functional  

### Sample Integration Output:
```bash
# Node Registration
INFO: Successfully registered with orchestrator node_id=c2d77c15-093e-489b-b2f7-7e62e5db2630

# Heartbeat Success
INFO: Node status changed old_status=Starting new_status=Active

# Fleet Statistics
curl http://127.0.0.1:3030/api/v1/fleet/stats
{"total_nodes":1,"active_nodes":1,"dead_nodes":0}
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Complete System Startup
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start orchestrator
cd orchestrator-node && cargo run

# Terminal 2: Start origin server
cd mitigation-node && cargo run --bin test-origin

# Terminal 3: Start mitigation node (auto-registers)
cd mitigation-node && cargo run --bin mitigation-node

# Terminal 4: Test connectivity and metrics
curl -k https://127.0.0.1:8443/
curl http://127.0.0.1:3030/api/v1/fleet/stats
curl http://127.0.0.1:9090/metrics
```

### Configuration
Update `config/default.toml` for orchestrator settings:
```toml
[orchestrator]
enabled = true
server_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3030"

[orchestrator.heartbeat]
interval = 30
timeout = 10
max_missed = 3
```
